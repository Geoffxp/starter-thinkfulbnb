# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

*This is only a mockup site and has no real function*

## The Purpose

This project was made to develop a good understanding of media queries and mobile-first design. The page is responsive to sizing and uses flexboxes and inline-blocks.

## Thinkfulbnb views

The UX designer provided you with the following user interface mockups:

### Mobile view

### Desktop view

#### Navigation

- The logo should stack on top of the menu links, which are aligned horizontally, as follows:

![Navigation mobile](./images/navigation-mobile.png)

- **Single-page navigation**: Modify the navigation links so that clicking on each link will take the user to the corresponding sections on the page, as follows:

| Link clicked | Take the user to the section with `id` of |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Stay`       | `id="stay"`                               |
| `About`      | `id="about"`                              |
| `Ideas`      | `id="ideas"`                              |
| `Host`       | `id="host"`                               |

#### HTML form

- In the "Find your perfect vacation rental" section, create a form that contains the following input fields with the specified types:

  - `Location`: `text` input type, with a placeholder value of "Search destination"
  - `Arrive`: `date` input type
  - `Depart`: `date` input type
  - `Type`: a dropdown list with the following options:
    - Apartment
    - Barn
    - Castle
    - Houseboat
    - Tiny House
    - Yacht
    - Yurt
  - a `"Search"` button

#### Vertical content alignment

- The content in the remainder of the sections (i.e., "About", "Ideas", "Want to become a Thinkfulbnb Host?"), including any text and images, should stack on top of each other. Refer to the mobile design shared above.

#### Responsive images

- All images match whatever container width they are placed within, and changing the container sizes will update the image sizes appropriately.

#### Media query: Desktop view

The logo and the navigation menu links should be spaced apart from each other, like this:

![Navigation desktop](./images/navigation-desktop.png)

- The search form input fields and the button should be horizontally aligned, like this:

![Search form desktop](./images/search-form-desktop.png)

- The items in the "About" section should be horizontally aligned. The paragraph content should be vertically centered and always be about twice as wide as each image item, like this:

![About desktop](./images/about-desktop.png)

- The "Ideas" images should be displayed in a 2 by 2 grid (see the desktop design shared above).

- The items in the "Want to Become a Thinkful Host?" section should be horizontally aligned. The paragraph content should be vertically centered and be as wide as each image item, like this:

![Host desktop](./images/host-desktop.png)
